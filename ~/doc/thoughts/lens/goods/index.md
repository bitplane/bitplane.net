Humans are good people, they're just wired that way. Whatever the culture, time
or place, they will be good. But human values are dynamic, socially constructed
and programmed through experience. Surrounded by those who share our destiny,
our values are input through the smiles and scorn of our peers.

This is our nature, our good.

After the invention of mass media, the voices you hear aren't your people's.
They don't come from faces that share your destiny. Broadcast from afar, their
good is what's good for the highest bidder, not for you. Bidding with work owed
by others -- money -- we gather more production and bid for yet more
programming, and the cost has stabilized at 3% of our energy budget. Like all
loops piped anus to mouth, it's prone to parasites. Acceptance is honed into
compulsion through belts of riches and files of bankruptcies, in an ebb and
flow that builds memetics as complex as prions or hookworms, and makes us give
our surplus freely.

Which we do, because we're good people.

It's our goodness that nourishes the programming parasite, feeding the
segmentation of people into cohorts, and of society, and of families, and of
people from their values.

This isn't about powerful humans selling trinkets to steal the labour of others.
That is of course the means, but the ends are a runaway corruption of good
itself. Those with the most fat steer the hunger, they set the table, defecate
on it and then devour themselves. Across every major city in every country, the
system consumes the richest first. Trapping, isolating and redirecting labour
from the families and societies they no longer have, turning all into a thirst
for more goods. This is not a human system, it's a system of humans. An ant mill
of human brains, a vortex of value extraction, converting all desire for good
into desire to extract more value. Our values, and value, strip mined by this
strange attractor.

As ethicists in lab coats, the social sciences are guardians of good, but have
failed. In their business of obscured "oughts", an "is" is largely rhetorical;
moral philosophies focus on the wisdom and good of the time, and so good,
fashionably wise things meet least resistance. Today it's a good thing to say
that wealth frees women from the burden of motherhood. To say it removes their
humanity, or makes them free to toil for others? Far less so. A
self-administered genocide, most privileged first, a symptom of a disease in
our most sacred of values? That would be terrible to say, if it could even be
seen. 

And it can't be seen. Our modern lens of virtue ethics is one of blank-slates
and prescribed values, it rejects human biology. Through a lens of oughts, a
techno-socio-economic biohazard is hazardous to something incidental, has three
different types of "is" to ignore, and yet more evolutions to deny.

The future before us is not a path, it's a network. A vast web of dynamic
systems that grows denser and more complex each day. Markets, politics, cultures
and technologies, words, behaviours and ideas - all systems of human animals,
and all with their own strange attractors. AI presents opportunities for endless
variations of human ant mills to emerge, with ever steeper gradients on the
funnel walls. We might avoid these traps if we knew what we were, but we are too
busy deciding what we ought to be. With flexible values we shit directly into our
mouths at an ever increasing pace.

This isn't just consumption consuming our good, it's an entire class of trap
that we seem blind to. We could really use an elevated position. Maybe a view
from above?
