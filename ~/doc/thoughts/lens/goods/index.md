Good is a social construct, and humans are good people - they're wired that way.
No matter the culture, time or place, they will be good. Human values are
dynamic, programmed through the faces they see and the voices they hear. Those
of people who share their destiny. We become good through the smiles and scorn
of our peers, this is our nature.

After mass media, the voices you hear aren't your people. They don't come from
faces that share your destiny. They're broadcast from afar, their good is what's
good for the highest bidder. Bidding is done with money, work owed by others,
and survivorship improves the programming, tunes so all that remains are ones
that compels us to give our surplus freely. Which we do, because we're good
people. This nourishes the programming organ, feeds segmentation of people into
cohorts, and of society, and families, and people from their values.

This isn't about people selling us trinkets to take our labour, the goods are
just the means, the ends are the runaway corruption of good itself. It's not a
human system, it's a system of humans. Like an ant vortex but for human brains,
it extracts value, converts it into the desire to extract more value. Our value.

The bulk of mass, those with the most fat both set the table and eat themselves;
across every major city in every country, this system devours the rich first.
Trapping, isolating and redirecting labour from the families and societies they
no longer have, turning it into a thirst for more goods.

The social sciences didn't see it coming, not even after it had arrived. As
ethicists in lab coats, they guard good itself. In the business of obscured
"oughts", an "is" is largely rhetorical; moral philosophy focuses on being wise
and good, and so they say good, fashionably wise things. Wealth frees women from
the burden of motherhood is a good thing. Removes their humanity, or makes them
free to toil for others, less so. A cultural genocide, most privileged first,
self-administered through a disease that feeds on the values we hold dear would
be a bad to say if it could even be seen.

And it can't. The modern lens of virtue ethics is one of blank-slates and
prescribed values, not human biology. And through this lens, any
techno-socio-economic biohazard has three different types of "is" to ignore, and
one more evolution to deny.

The future before us is a network of dynamic systems that grow denser and more
complex each day. Markets, politics, cultures and technologies, words,
behaviours and ideas. But mostly systems of human animals. AI presents
opportunities for endless variations of human ant vortices to emerge. And to
avoid these traps we need to know what we are before what we should be.

Our clergy are blind and not fit to lead. We desperately need a better view, a
systems level view; a view from above.
