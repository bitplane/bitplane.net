# ‚öñÔ∏è Juriscrudence

Physical Law is a tower made of hows, built from the top down, through
centuries of careful measurement and painstaking calculation. It grants almost
magical powers of prediction, explaining how this thing happens and that. It's
what all of our technology is built on, and is arguably our finest creation.
Many believe these hows to be whys, and think that if we build deep enough we
will one day reach foundations. This idea is without grounds.

## üëΩ The Thirst Law

Long ago, aliens discovered Theory of Quenching. This states that living
humans will consume water several times a day, and can never go longer than
4 days without a drink. Confirmed by centuries of abductee experiments,
quenching theory eventually earned its place as the First Law of Human Motion,
a physical law explaining *why* humans gasp and clamour for water.

Thirst, it seems, was an alien concept.

## ü™û Its and Us Things

People in another timeline discovered Orb's Laws. These state that firstly, all
planets must orbit their sun, and secondly that all moons must orbit their
planets. Things that passed through or were flung out of our solar system were
not planets or moons, and not just because they didn't stick around for long
enough to be seen, but because that would violate Orb's laws. After next
Tuesday's event, they say, the world will end and the moon start its new orbit
around the sun. Thanks to Orb's Laws, we can be sure that whoever evolves next
will learn the Truth, and know that Luna *is* a planet.

## üôä Commandments

Scribbled onto a thin sheet of wood with a brownest crayon, the mouth sounds of
apes can predict many things with remarkable accuracy. But these physical *laws*
can't prescribe, only describe. The babblings of apes can only command apes,
they are only the reasons why apes move, and what apes think. And how things
appear to unfold are rarely why things happen. Us things are us things, and it
things are something else.
