# ‚öñÔ∏è Jurisprudence

Physical Law is a tower made of hows, and was built from the top down, through
the centuries by careful measurements and painstaking calculations. It grants
almost magical powers of prediction, explaining how this thing happens and that.
It's what all of our technology is built on, and is arguably our finest
creation. To the untrained eye these hows look like whys. Many believe that if
build deep enough we will one day reach the foundations. This idea itself rests
on future discoveries; it's without grounds.

Long ago, aliens discovered The Law of Quenching. This law states that living
humans will consume water several times a day, and will never go longer than
4 days without a drink. After centuries of abductee experiments, the Theory
of Quenching earned its place as a fundamental law of human motion, explaining
*why* humans gasp and clamour for water. Thirst, it seems, is an alien concept.

People in another timeline discovered Orb's Laws. These state that firstly, all
planets must orbit their sun, and secondly that all moons must orbit their
planets. Things that passed through or were flung out of our solar system were
not planets, and not just because they didn't stick around for long enough to be
seen, but because that would violate Orb's first law. After next Tuesday's
event, they say, the will end and the moon starts its new orbit around the sun.
And we can be sure that whoever evolves next will learn Orb's Truths, and know
that Luna *is* a planet.

Our laws of physics are not the boss of the universe, they're the voice of apes
scrawled on paper. The sounds we use to describe things are not the things
themselves, how things seem to unfold are not why things happen. These are an us
thing, not an it thing. Whatever it is, is something else.
