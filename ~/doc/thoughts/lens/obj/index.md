We live in a universe of fluids; of radiation, gas, plasma and liquid. And also
a tiny bit of solids, which hardly deserve a mention.

From a crust-centric stance, everything is an object. We are objects that eat
food objects, seek objects give us shelter and - at risk of objectifying - sex.
We raise smaller objects, and our 2.5 dimensional territory is split into place
objects. We build tool objects from smaller objects, which we use to transform
one type of object into another. Everything is an object. A cloud is an object,
the sun is an object, the fire that warms us is a fire not some fire, the
stream we can't step into twice is a clue-shaped conundrum object. We have a
drink and breathe a breath, and consider a wave and a rock to be very different
types of object.

Science is the practice of empiricism, that is, of measuring to discover
objective truth. And in empiricism, something must be observed multiple times in
order to exist. Through these observations we discover the rules - word objects
that every atom object must obey.

The universe, objectively speaking, is the object that contains all objects.
And some other things, which hardly deserve a mention.
