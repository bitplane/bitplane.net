WIP:

Before the Internet nobody knew how old Sean Connery was. You'd read his age in
a magazine, but the journalist hadn't seen his birth certificate, they were just
saying what someone else told them.

After Wikipedia, everyone knew his date of birth like it's an indisputable fact,
Jimmy Wales is adamant that Wikipedia is without bias, which he obviously doesn't
see as a bias.
