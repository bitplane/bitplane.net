# Truth

WIP:

Before the Internet nobody knew how old Sean Connery was. You'd read his age in
a magazine, but the journalist hadn't seen his birth certificate, they were just
saying what someone else told them. In 1999 Generation X argued in the pub about
aliens at Area 51 or whether ghosts existed or not, and nobody really knew or
cared. True believers were either mentally unwell or thought they knew better
because their parents bought an encyclopaedia set for 2 grand from a door to
door salesman. "Yeah? Well, you know, that's just like uh, your opinion, man"
defines the last hours of the pre-truth era, before Truth with a capital T
arrived.

Then the Internet turned up and Truth with a capital T was born. 

After Wikipedia, everyone knew his date of birth like it's an indisputable fact,
Jimmy Wales is adamant that Wikipedia is without bias, which he obviously doesn't
see as a bias.
