The old family recipe for cake

## notes

The parable is about fairy cakes, that the recipe says the fairies come and they
make the cakes rise if you add the magic dust, sing their verse in full, and
never once peep while they're filling the cakes with their fluffy magic
goodness.

Then we decide we dont believe in fairies, and we stop believing in the recipe.
We throw out the magic raising dust because we don't believe in its magic, we
open the door and look at the cakes, and forget the rhythm and meter of the
song.

And the cakes burn, and they never rise. We eat our rock hard burnt dough and
are smug about how much better our technique is. We won't even try them.
refuse to even taste e won't even taste them, we'll never know how good they are.

## ♪?

Maybe it should be a song?

Please forgive us
The ladies of the cake
We made a grave mistake
