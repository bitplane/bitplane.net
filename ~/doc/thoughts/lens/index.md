# 🔍 The shape of a lens

To have a view of something you've got to actually be stood somewhere, so any
view of reality will never be a clear one. It's a view from the inside, looking
in. One obscured by details, warped our lens and clouded by its cataracts.

When others are blind to things we understand, it's tempting to think we have
a superior viewpoint. Sometimes this is true. But, there is no all-seeing view
that reveals what we're blind to, and every misunderstanding is the emotion of
understanding before arriving at hindsight.

The following sections explore a few viewpoints with as much ridicule as I can
muster, but far less than they deserve. They offer no clarity of vision, but
might help make us more careful drivers.
