# 🔍 The shape of a lens

To have a view of something you've got to actually be stood somewhere, so any
view of reality will never be a clear one. It's a view from the inside, looking
in. One obscured by the details, warped by our lens and clouded by its
cataracts.

When others are blind to the things we understand, it's tempting to think that
we have a superior viewpoint. And sometimes this is true. But, there is no
all-seeing view that reveals what we're blind to, and every misunderstanding is
the emotion of understanding - at least before arriving at hindsight.

The following sections explore a few viewpoints with as much ridicule as I can
muster, but far less than they deserve. They offer no clarity of vision, but
might one day help us to become more careful drivers.
