## Emergence

There's no way to stack bricks so that they become a gas, there's no way you
can arrange wooden blocks to become a magnet, there's no way you can place
water so it stands as a cube, and there's no program you can run on a
Turing machine that makes it conscious.

## Nondeterministic Turing Machines

A computer that runs every branch at every step, using exponentially more
resources as it goes is equivalent to one that has infinite space and time, and
they are both equivalent to perpetual motion machines.
