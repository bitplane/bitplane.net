# â›” Failure's Prize

```text
It's been a while
Too long
Too short on time to try to start again
It fell apart
Too bad
The cowardice to carry on is spent

Now behold: the awful prize of failure
At life and only reason to persist
An exit clause: a full and final saviour
A certainty of only two exist

I never tried
Too much
My mistake at last I understand
So I decide
To go
Five years without the courage that I planned

We misaligned our culture's deal with slavery
Society that fails now foots the bill
Life and home's the only thing to save me
Men die because that's gone not 'cause they're ill

It's been a while
Too long
Too far too late to get back up again
So it's goodbye
So long
So sorry to my family and friends
```
