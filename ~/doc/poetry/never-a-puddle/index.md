# Never a Puddle

```text
drip drip drip drip
poison seeds that lay in shit
malice in the growth each bit
a tendril for each goal asplit
entwine and bind manipulate
rottings of all good to hate
thorns of drain and cut and shred
black the heart, and bind the head
till ones they love will want them dead
drip drip drip drip
a drip a twisting to attack
each drip a cruelty no way back
forgiveness time and pain may heal
but fools are scarred and be their meal
```

## footnote

Actually a suicide note as the result of a psychotic episode that lasted for
weeks. The voices were pretty mean to me, I guess I wasn't happy with myself.
At least some good came out of it.
