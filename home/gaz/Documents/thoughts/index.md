* ðŸ“„ [Hydropsychism - Water of Mind](hydropsychism) -
  Putting the stuff from the previous two articles into a more formal argument,
  and making an empirically testable theory of consciousness.

* ðŸ“ƒ [Evolution denial](evolution-denial) -
  an argument that determinisms like computationalim denies the fact of
  evolution of mind, as will is the only mechanism that can cause it to
  evolve.

* ðŸ“ƒ [Musings on Cargo Cult Consciousness](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oFiHwuuS8LAYqRNFh/musings-on-cargo-cult-consciousness) -
  Less Wrong didn't like it. Partly because of the style, and partly because
  it calls out the irrational Christian heritage that's baked into the
  culture of science, and partly because it offends their religious beliefs
  as computationalists. I've not had any decent arguments against the content
  though.
  I'd like to break it down into a bunch of different articles, and eventually
  make them into a series of videos.
