## ⚖️ Jurisprudence

Physical Law is a tower made of hows, and was built from the top down, through
the centuries by careful measurements and painstaking calculations. It grants
almost magical powers of prediction, explaining how this thing happens and
that, it's what all of our technology is built on, and is arguably our finest
creation. To the untrained eye these hows look like whys, and many believe that
if build deep enough we will one day reach the foundations. This is an idea
without grounds.

Long ago, aliens discovered The Law of Quenching. This law states that living
humans will consume water several times a day, and will never go longer than
4 days without a drink. After centuries of abductee experiments, the Theory
of Quenching earned its place as a fundamental law of human motion, explaining
*why* humans gasp and clamour for water. Thirst, it seems, is an alien concept.

Another set of laws are Orb's Laws, that is, all planets must orbit their sun,
and that all moons must orbit their planets. Things flung out of our solar
system were not planets, not just because they didn't stick around for long
enough to be seen, but because that would violate Orb's first law. Next Tuesday,
they say, the moon will start its new orbit around the sun. Hopefully, whoever
evolves next will learn Orb's Truth and know that Luna *is* a planet.

Our laws of physics are not the boss of the universe, they're the voice of apes
scrawled on paper. The sounds we use to describe things are not the things
themselves, how things seem to unfold are not why things happen. These are an us
thing, not an it thing. Whatever it is, is something else.
