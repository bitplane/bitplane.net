# üîç The shape of a lens

To have a view of something you've got to actually be stood somewhere, so any
view of reality will never be a clear one. It's a view from the inside, looking
in. One obscured by details, warped our lens and clouded by its cataracts.

When others are blind to things we understand, it's tempting to think we have
a superior viewpoint. Sometimes this is true. But, there is no all-seeing view
that reveals what we're blind to, and every misunderstanding is the emotion of
understanding before arriving at hindsight.

The following sections explore a few viewpoints with as much ridicule as I can
muster, but far less than they deserve. They offer no clarity of vision, but
might help make us more careful drivers.

The universe is made of fluids; radiation, gas, plasma and liquid. And also a
tiny bit of solids, which hardly deserve a mention.

From a crust-centric stance, everything is an object. We are objects that eat
food objects, seek objects give us shelter and - at risk of objectifying - sex.
We raise smaller objects, and our 2.5 dimensional territory is split into place
objects. We build tool objects from smaller objects, which we use to transform
one type of object into another. Everything is an object. A cloud is an object,
the sun is an object, the fire that warms us is a fire not some fire, the
stream we can't step into twice is a clue-shaped conundrum object. We have a
drink and breathe a breath, and consider a wave and a rock to be very different
types of object.

Science is the practice of empiricism, that is, of measuring to discover
objective truth. And in empiricism, something must be observed multiple times in
order to exist. Through these observations we discover the rules - word
objects - that every atom object. 

The universe, objectively speaking, is the object that contains all objects.
And some other things, which hardly deserve a mention.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Jurisprudence

Physical Law is a tower made of hows, and was built from the top down, through
the centuries by careful measurements and painstaking calculations. It grants
almost magical powers of prediction, explaining how this thing happens and
that, it's what all of our technology is built on, and is arguably our finest
creation. To the untrained eye these hows look like whys, and many believe that
if build deep enough we will one day reach the foundations. This is an idea
without grounds.

Long ago, aliens discovered The Law of Quenching. This law states that living
humans will consume water several times a day, and will never go longer than
4 days without a drink. After centuries of abductee experiments, the Theory
of Quenching earned its place as a fundamental law of human motion, explaining
*why* humans gasp and clamour for water. Thirst, it seems, is an alien concept.

Another set of laws are Orb's Laws, that is, all planets must orbit their sun,
and that all moons must orbit their planets. Things flung out of our solar
system were not planets, not just because they didn't stick around for long
enough to be seen, but because that would violate Orb's first law. Next Tuesday,
they say, the moon will start its new orbit around the sun. Hopefully, whoever
evolves next will learn Orb's Truth and know that Luna *is* a planet.

Our laws of physics are not the boss of the universe, they're the voice of apes
scrawled on paper. The sounds we use to describe things are not the things
themselves, how things seem to unfold are not why things happen. These are an
us thing, not an it thing. Whatever it is, is something else.

## üé≤ Rumblists

Stuck in a flat Earth in a sealed box, our brightest minds seek to know the
source of rumblings, a mystery as old as time. And they 

Up, down, charm, and strange

Say you live in a box and are perplexed by rumbling sounds that happen
periodically. You measure the incident times, which are totally unpredictable
with the information you have (being stuck in a box) but they follow an
interesting pattern. You create a probability function that fits the
measurements perfectly. The result is that you can predict these rumblings on
average with remarkable accuracy, other people in your box are impressed. Is it
fair to assume that the rumblings are actually random in nature? 

Does this apparent randomness prove that randomness underpins the nature of
reality? Is the mystery of the rumblings actually solved? Well it turns out the
rumbling sounds are actually buses driving past outside. What you have made is
a model, a busfunction that's a conjugation of the bus timetable and average
deviations from it due to variations in local traffic. But you don't know a road
is because you live in a box. There's no way out of the box, no way to learn
what a road even is and so the mystery of the rumbling sounds is actually
completely unknowable in your universe. But the fact that you modelled it as a
probability function led you to believe that buses themselves were random, and
this in turn led you to believe in randomness itself. That is faulty reasoning 
regardless. The problem is, we fundamentally cant tell the difference between
something that's unpredictable and something that's random. Whether I have a bus
timetable or not doesn't change that. And back on topic, randomness doesn't lead
to the evolution of minds.

Once upon a time, there were people who lived in a box. There was no way to ever
see outside the box, but 

# üìö Pulp Monofiction

On a dusty shelf in the library of mind sits a book not very wide. Its title is
short fiction, and claims every book's inside. Open up the pages and it presents
a strange surprise: that every letter's different, these stories seem disguised.

To the untrained eye or those without time it's a random stream of glyphs, but
if you care to learn a language, you can map a story onto this. And if you share
this tongue with others and point them at this pad, then they can read your
story (if it doesn't drive them mad.)

This impractical tome allows a tale to be known by everyone who shares a code,
but they don't - and they won't - as that's not why it was made. The reason it
exists is this - to prove a point about our age. That words don't exist as ink
on a page, they're experienced when read. To read, interact is a physical act,
it stirs us; it moves us.

Binary's look is a lot like this book, without a language map it's a long stream
of crap - it looks like random bits, it's not a language for us humans, it's for
computer chips. A machine's code are the only words it knows, a tongue of
circuit wires. And as it reads, makes sense of it, it shifts it deep inside.
Where we see jumbled digits, it `mov eax, 5`. It knows, interacts - in a
physical act. This whirs it; and moves it.

To you or I its outputs are words or sights or sounds. We feel and hear and see
them, no matter how profound, these concepts are our story, they're one a chip
knows nothing of. It's one it needs no language for as logic is enough. These 

one the chip has no language for. Higher order patterns can't move the chip,
they aren't physically experienced by it. Your monitor can never know the smile
it shows, a speaker will never feel its music, and the microphone near the
proverbial tree will never hear a sound as it falls.

When a program outputs tales of its thoughts, both the thoughts and the thinker
are an us thing, they're our story and exist within us. A program is an us
thing, electrified silicon is what exists. That silicon reads the tale and is
shaken, it vibrates with a clatter of logic gates and the beat of a digital
clock. An not one thing more.

## The spirit of the ages

* Heraclitus: Everything is fire
* Mechanical age: The universe as a clockwork mechanism (Descartes, Newton)
* Industrial age: Thermodynamic models of mind and society
* Electrical age: The brain as a telegraph/telephone switchboard
* Computer age: Mind as information processing
* Network age: Reality as emergent from connections and relationships
* AI age: Intelligence/consciousness as pattern recognition and prediction
