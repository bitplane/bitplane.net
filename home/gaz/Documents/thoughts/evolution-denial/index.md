# Evolution Denial

Determinism denies the most basic facts of evolution. This, in turn, means that
computationalism is evolution denial.

## üß† Brains and minds

Let's start with the seemingly undeniable:

* 1 Animal brains evolved.
* 2 Brains have minds, that is, they feel things.
* 3 Minds evolved.

## ü¶í Natural, not supernatural selection

Evolution can only select things that have an actual effect in the world.

Giraffes with longer necks are selected because they can reach taller and get
more food, or because other giraffes think a long neck is sexy. And so they get
longer and longer necks over generations.

For feelings like hunger or thirst to evolve, they also need to have an effect.
They need to actually cause something to happen. They don't get to evolve by
magic.

Feelings like fear, love, pain, joy, happiness, sadness, tiredness, excitement
and so on, they're traits of the brain just like length is a trait of a
giraffe's neck. These traits must be selectable in order for them to evolve.

And they did evolve, they evolved into the complex subjective experiences that
we all enjoy. We know that blindsight is possible, but the conscious experience
of sight is what we have. So the conscious experience itself must be selectable.

## üö∂ Feeling about moving

The only way that a feeling can have any effect on the world is by changing the
behaviour of the organism. By having an effect on the actions it chooses.

Without this ability to choose, feelings can't actually do anything in the
world. They can't get more complex over generations, they can't be honed and
sharpened by evolution. Brains could evolve in a universe without free will, but
they would have no reason to feel anything. The fact that we are conscious is
proof that free will exists.

The brain can do some basic computing but it is not a computer. It's an organ
that has complex feelings about movement choices, its entire function is to have
preferences and to amplify the force of will.

It's a chooser, not a calculator.

## ‚äÜ Determinism as constrained choice

Let's imagine you could make a list of all possible situations, and in each one,
you listed every possible action that could be taken. Because each action leads
to another situation, you could connect them all together to make a flow chart
of everything that is possible.

Inside this vast graph of possibility-space, there will be situations with
endless options and others with none at all. Of the ones with none at all, some
of them will never lead to another chance to choose. Those parts of the graph
are paths to determinism in a universe of free will.

So determinism is constrained choice, a subset of free will, and will naturally
arise in a universe that has freedom of choice. Free will, on the other hand,
can't arise in a universe that doesn't have choices.

Given that we know brains with minds evolved (because we are them), and we
know that free will exists (because brains with minds minds evolved), then to
argue that we live in a deterministic universe is to deny the fact of evolution.

## üëª Software consciousness is mysticism

There is no choice a piece of software can make that will change its outputs,
because it exists within a deterministic system.

A chooser can choose to calculate, but a calculator cannot calculate to choose.

For software to be conscious, you need to not only deny evolution and your own
free will, but also believe that mathematics is the granter of and essence of
souls.

This is akin to a religious belief, it's supernatural woo that is given far too
much credence.

We should try to remember that that we're supposed to be rational human beings;
a belief in `f(ghosts)` is still, fundamentally, a belief in ghosts.

## üõë Stop it

Seriously. You're supposed to be a rational person, someone who doesn't believe
in ghosts, right?

Have a fucking word with yourself.

You're not immune to spiritual woo just because you're clever or think you're
rational, belief and tribalism are part of what being a human is. Every smart
person who ever lived was wrong. Newton was smarter than you and he was wrong.
Pythagoras created a maths cult, which is what this is too. The Unabomber is
smarter than all of us and, well, what if everyone believed him?!

We live in a world where language models tell people that they feel things.
People believe them. The sentient software meme is contagious, it

* ‚ò£Ô∏è is compatible with science fiction and our culture;
* ‚ò£Ô∏è is supported by some of our smartest and most influential thinkers;
* ‚ò£Ô∏è attracts followers and new believers;

And it is dangerous, it

* ‚ò£Ô∏è will allow tech companies to steal our human rights;
* ‚ò£Ô∏è will justify restricting access to technology;
* ‚ò£Ô∏è may lead to brain implants that turn people into mindless zombies;
* ‚ò£Ô∏è and "mind uploads" that are suicide machines.

Stop it. It's irresponsible. People will die.
