# Hydro-Panpsychism

20 years ago I thought the brain was like a whistle, and consciousness the song
it made. But I dropped the idea because, well, what even is this magical breeze?
Why should we believe one exists?

I recently came to a conclusion that made me a bit uncomfortable because it
smells like homeopathy. But it isn't, I promise. It makes sense.

So let's start with the premises:

* 



## 🌊 



All stuff is aware and has agency, but evolutionary selection pressures on the
very agency of the fluid we evolved in is our source of experience and will,
and the structures that channel it retain the hydrodynamics component. Our
type of subjective experience is one of vibrations in water.


## empirically testable?

If true:

* 🧠 fluid dynamics patterns between brain cells should correlate with
  subjective experiences.
* 🧪 changing the viscosity of liquid should have measurable behavioural
  effects on animal cognition.
* 📏 neuron shape and size correlations with the speed of sound in water. If
  standing waves and/or interference patterns are a key component of sentience,
  we'd expect this to be expressed as the ratio of certain shapes.
* state transitions in nerve signals ought to be constrained by vibrating water
  components.
