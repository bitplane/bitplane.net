# Abstract

The mystery of consciousness has baffled philosophers for centuries, yet Hard
Problems remain. Current computational models rely on a strong emergentist
dualism, treating mind as a mathematical abstraction with no causal effect on
natural selection. Panpsychist models are elegant but fail to explain how
subjective experience integrates into unified selves.

This paper proposes **hydropsychism** - the hypothesis that **the self is simply
the water in and around neurons**. This view is a simple panpsychist model that
explains evolution of mind from the earliest stages, lacks paradoxes, matches
observation and leads to testable predictions. This opens up the door to
building conscious machines.

# Metaphysics

*Cogito, ergo sum* was a decent starting point, but Descartes didn't go far
enough; there are some other things that I am. I'm in a location, I experience
my surroundings and the passage of time, I feel, and more importantly - I choose
how to move; I have will. And sometimes, the will to think.

Monists, idealists and panpsychists successfully applied Occam's razor to the
thinking part, and reasonably concluded that there's no need for two different
mind and matter stuffs. Matter is what mind looks like from a distance, or, when
more generous with the blade, it is the totality of existence itself. And yet
there's still much more to slice away. An objective reality can emerge from a
web of subjective interactions, and having experienced both of those directly
it is rational to consider the objective world a second order effect. Space can
be framed so that distance is a relative compatability of the things within it -
the likelihood of interactions between them - rather than a boundless and
ghostly container. And as importantly as before - we know that choice is the
cause of our actions, and so without evidence to the contrary, we should assume
it's the same of other stuff.

If the cause rather than commandment is the cause of actions, then physical laws
are nothing more than our own observations; all we can observe is the aggregate
preference of mind-stuff, statistically.

Having left the concept of natural laws and looking back from enough distance,
they resemble a cognitive bias at the heart of scientific tradition; the quest
to discover the laws of a rule-giver we have long forsaken. Our path leads to a
model of an entirely subjective and relative reality, one lacking not only a
creator and His laws, but is without a physical realm at all.

In this new model, mind-stuff is the only stuff and it acts according to its
will; it is and it does as it feels.

# Evolution of Mind

This position of "doing as it feels" reveals a simple mechanism by which mind
can evolve, and from up here we can see all the way back to abiogenesis.

When stuff chooses how to act based on what's around it, its actions then
change its surroundings, and this in turn changes how it feels. This simple
process allows for feedback loops where structure, feelings and action can be
naturally selected. With selection pressures able to act directly on feelings
and choices, they can evolve structurally, step by step - a process that is
required for sapient life to emerge.

Through this process, the simplest molecules with the weakest preferences can
be honed, through survival, into systems with staunch opinions and a powerful
force of will.

If we lived in a universe made from experience and agency, we would expect
to see no boundary where they emerge. No matter how hard we look, or how
strongly we believe there is one, agency should extend all the way to the
bottom. The will to move would be present (though less coordinated) in not
just organisms without nervous systems, but also within their cytoplasm. An
amoeba's pseudopods would extend and retract with an apparent intent, and
white blood cells might chase invaders with what looks like urgency. If all
Brownian motion is choice, then we should not be surprised that the inner
workings of cells show an eerie similarity to creatures at larger scales.
And it should apply across scales of time too; viewed at high speed, plants
would writhe and thrash around as they struggle to survive. Such
anthropomorphisms do not meet the high bar of scientific proof, yet these
observations provide clues, ones that once seen, are very difficult to unsee.

## Supernatural Selection

There's no reason why animals with brains couldn't evolve in a deterministic
universe, digital simulations suggest that they would. But in such systems -
ones without free will - there are no selection pressures to ratchet up a
complexity of mind. So what would evolve is control-calculation organs rather
than feeling-about-moving ones.

Deterministic models like computationalism and mathematical functionalism are
free from will, and so offer no causal mechanism through which mind can evolve.
Until one can be demonstrated, these symbolic dualisms are functionally
indistinguishable from evolution denial.

# Informational Awareness

When described in terms of mass and electromagetism, of particles and forces,
we can describe and predict the behaviour of stuff, but this cannot explain the
cause of its behaviour. By definition, a subjective experience cannot be
measured objectively, so how another system feels will be forever beyond
empiricism's reach. If we invent technology to connect other systems to our
brains and share their experience, these experiences are no longer entirely
subjective. With this in mind, we should consider the possibility that
subjectivity itself may not be absolute, like all other things it's a matter of
perspective.

In a universe where action is a choice, action gives some insight into degrees
of preference and ignorance, though how much of each are involved remain private
to the chooser. We could say that atoms on the surface of a gold bar are unaware
of the call of the sky, or strongly prefer to stay where they are. Neutrinos
could be said to be either fickle or free, with no way to know which. This
somewhat absurd framing grants an insight: if stuff is and does as it feels,
then in one sense or another it feels little about what it *doesn't* do.

Actions as interaction choices provides a useful framing for quantum physics and
information theory. Randomness and unknowableness are equivalent, and we know
that unknowableness exists; randomness does not survive the razor. This and
entropy can be described as limits to awareness itself, a minimum experiential
distance from an observer; both superposition and entanglement can be framed as
an experiential exclusion from a decision chain. And if forces themselves are
preferences, then their carriers are decisions rather than particles.

The more agency a system has then the less predictable it will be. So knowing
what something can do says a bit about the limits of its agency, and by
extension its possible awareness. So, without assuming all men are Socrates,
it's quite reasonable to expect fluids to be far more aware, or at least have 
far more capacity for awareness, than solids, that are by comparison express
no opinion.

# Hydropsychism

Life evolved on Earth through action, and if action is choice then water is our
lead actor. This makes life's story less one about chemicals stumbling upon
awareness, it's one of taming the ocean's will - fragmenting it, dividing it,
and dragging it onto land. It's the water that flows and moves, it folds and
unfolds proteins, pulling them together and pushing them apart. Hydrophobic and
hydrophilic forces grant all cells their structure, but it's the water that
expresses philia and phobia rather than the lipids. Water is the solvent of all
enzymes, the medium that transcribes our DNA, and ribozymes mediate reactions
through its fluidity far more than their own. Fish don't realize they're in
water. The same can be said of organic chemistry.

If the seat of consciousness is fluid rather than quantum dynamics, made of
ordinary physical processes rather than computational dualism, then we don't
need to push the idea of mind into complexity or the gaps of ignorance. It's
simply what stuff is.

So, aside from determinism being functionally equivalent to evolution denial,
the central point of this paper is that neurons don't provide consciousness,
they vibrate fluid around them, changing the way it feels to be that liquid.

# Predictions

If consciousness is fluid-dynamics, then this ought to be observable or
disproveable. As a lay-philosopher-hacker rather than a biologist, so I may
be wrong about the implications, but they at least provide a starting point
for future research.

Neurons ought to disturb the fluid physically, amplifying and dampening waves
through interference patterns at different frequencies. The structure of the
network and the way the neurons fire would flow in rhythmic patterns.

We should expect areas to do with learning to change in a geometric fashion as
well as along the network. If awareness, or the cause of it propagates outwards
from the axons rather than just along the network, areas connected only by
fluids ought to change around the focal or convergence points of functional
areas related to different experiences.

Awareness, or some manifestations of it, should travel faster than neural
activity, at the speed of sound in saline. We should expect certain ratios to
emerge, and for there to be types of neural structures that cancel each other
out by their geometric position.

Neural networks that provide a similar function need not be entirely local,
rhythmically together, rather than purely local calculations.

Ultrasound would have perceptual, and induce cognitive effects. Beta and alpha
waves would feel perceptually smooth and sharp. Brain pressure would be
destructive to consciousness, but cognitive function would be more robust than
the neural fibres. Hallucinogenics of different types would likely cause sync
issues that expose interference patterns with a perceptual texture of the
structure of the brain, rather than the network. Anasthetics would be likely
to have measurable effects on fluid dynamics, though this may be difficult to
prove causually.

Experiences would feel fluid, rather than discrete firings of neurons. It should
be possible to measure consciousness and unconsciousness vibrationally, and by
applying vibrations in the right places, it ought to be possible to invoke
feelings or perceptual 

# Further thoughts: is water special?

Does the hexagonal structure of water somehow align with the 3 spatial
dimensions in a way that resonates with, or provides access to, the properties
from which space itself emerges? If all distance is a likelihood of interaction,
then space itself can be viewed in terms of preference or awareness. The
colliding blocks model of pi seems to suggest that dimensionality emerges from
oscillations, and if water's lattice is aligned so its both relative and aligned
with this, waves within it may align with space itself.

# Conclusion: Little Bags of Thinking Water

Pratchett described human beings as "little bags of thinking water held up
briefly by fragile accumulations of calcium", and despite us all believing we
were the bag, it turns out he was right all along.
