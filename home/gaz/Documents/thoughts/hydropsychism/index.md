# Abstract

The mystery of consciousness has baffled philosophers for centuries, yet Hard
Problems remain. Current computational models rely on a strong emergentist
dualism, treating mind as a mathematical abstraction with no causal effect on
natural selection. Panpsychist models are elegant but fail to explain how
subjective experience integrates into unified selves.

This paper proposes **hydropsychism** - the hypothesis that **the self is simply
the water in and around neurons**. This view is a simple panpsychist model that
explains evolution of mind from the earliest stages, lacks paradoxes, matches
observation and leads to testable predictions. This opens up the door to
building conscious machines.

# Metaphysics

*Cogito, ergo sum* was a decent starting point, but Descartes didn't go far
enough; there are some other things that I am. I'm in a location, I experience
my surroundings and the passage of time, I feel, and more importantly - I choose
how to move; I have will. And sometimes, the will to think.

Monists, idealists and panpsychists successfully applied Occam's razor to the
thinking part, and reasonably concluded that there's no need for two different
mind and matter stuffs. Matter is what mind looks like from a distance, or, when
more generous with the blade, it is the totality of existence itself. And yet
there's still much more to slice away. An objective reality can emerge from a
web of subjective interactions, and having experienced both of those directly
it is rational to consider the objective world a second order effect. Space can
be framed so that distance is a relative compatability of the things within it -
the likelihood of interactions between them - rather than a boundless and
ghostly container. And as importantly as before - we know that choice is the
cause of our actions, and so without evidence to the contrary, we should assume
it's the same of other stuff.

If the cause rather than commandment is the cause of actions, then physical laws
are nothing more than our own observations; all we can observe is the aggregate
preference of mind-stuff, statistically.

Having left the concept of natural laws and looking back from enough distance,
they resemble a cognitive bias at the heart of scientific tradition; the quest
to discover the laws of a rule-giver we have long forsaken. Our path leads to a
model of an entirely subjective and relative reality, one lacking not only a
creator and His laws, but is without a physical realm at all.

In this new model, mind-stuff is the only stuff and it acts according to its
will; it is and it does as it feels.

# Evolution of Mind

This position of "doing as it feels" reveals a simple mechanism by which mind
can evolve, and from up here we can see all the way back to abiogenesis.

When stuff chooses how to act based on what's around it, its actions then
change its surroundings, and this in turn changes how it feels. This simple
process allows for feedback loops where structure, feelings and action can be
naturally selected. With selection pressures able to act directly on feelings
and choices, they can evolve structurally, step by step - a process that is
required for sapient life to emerge.

Through this process, the simplest molecules with the weakest preferences can
be honed, through survival, into systems with staunch opinions and a powerful
force of will.

If we lived in a universe made from experience and agency, we would expect
to see no boundary where they emerge. No matter how hard we look, or how
strongly we believe there is one, agency should extend all the way to the
bottom. The will to move would be present (though less coordinated) in not
just organisms without nervous systems, but also within their cytoplasm. An
amoeba's pseudopods would extend and retract with an apparent intent, and
white blood cells might chase invaders with what looks like urgency. If all
Brownian motion is choice, then we should not be surprised that the inner
workings of cells show an eerie similarity to creatures at larger scales.
And it should apply across scales of time too; viewed at high speed, plants
would writhe and thrash around as they struggle to survive. Such
anthropomorphisms do not meet the high bar of scientific proof, yet these
observations provide clues, ones that once seen, are very difficult to unsee.

## Supernatural Selection

There's no reason why animals with brains couldn't evolve in a deterministic
universe, digital simulations suggest that they would. But in such systems -
ones without free will - there are no selection pressures to ratchet up a
complexity of mind. So what would evolve is control-calculation organs rather
than feeling-about-moving ones.

Deterministic models like computationalism and mathematical functionalism are
free from will, and so offer no causal mechanism through which mind can evolve.
Until one can be demonstrated, these symbolic dualisms are functionally
indistinguishable from evolution denial.

# Informational Awareness

When described in terms of mass and electromagetism, of particles and forces,
we can describe and predict the behaviour of stuff, but this cannot explain the
cause of its behaviour. By definition, a subjective experience cannot be
measured objectively, so how another system feels will be forever beyond
empiricism's reach. If we invent technology to connect other systems to our
brains and share their experience, these experiences are no longer entirely
subjective. With this in mind, we should consider the possibility that
subjectivity itself may not be absolute, like all other things it's a matter of
perspective.

In a universe where action is a choice, action gives some insight into degrees
of preference and ignorance, though how much of each are involved remain private
to the chooser. We could say that atoms on the surface of a gold bar are unaware
of the call of the sky, or strongly prefer to stay where they are. Neutrinos
could be said to be either fickle or free, with no way to know which. This
somewhat absurd framing grants an insight: if stuff is and does as it feels,
then in one sense or another it feels little about what it *doesn't* do.

Actions as interaction choices provides a useful framing for quantum physics and
information theory. Randomness and unknowableness are equivalent, and we know
that unknowableness exists; randomness does not survive the razor. This and
entropy can be described as limits to awareness itself, a minimum experiential
distance from an observer; both superposition and entanglement can be framed as
an experiential exclusion from a decision chain. And if forces themselves are
preferences, then their carriers are decisions rather than particles.

The more agency a system has then the less predictable it will be. So knowing
what something can do says a bit about the limits of its agency, and by
extension its possible awareness. So, without assuming all men are Socrates,
it's quite reasonable to expect fluids to be far more aware, or at least have 
far more capacity for awareness, than solids, that are by comparison express
no opinion.

# Hydropsychism

Life evolved on Earth through action, and if action is choice then water is our
lead actor. This makes life's story less one about chemicals stumbling upon
awareness, it's one of taming the ocean's will - fragmenting it, dividing it,
and dragging it onto land. It's the water that flows and moves, it folds and
unfolds proteins, pulling them together and pushing them apart. Hydrophobic and
hydrophilic forces grant all cells their structure, but it's the water that
expresses philia and phobia rather than the lipids. Water is the solvent of all
enzymes, the medium that transcribes our DNA, and ribozymes mediate reactions
through its fluidity far more than their own. Fish don't realize they're in
water. The same can be said of organic chemistry.

If the seat of consciousness is held by fluid rather than quantum dynamics,
ordinary physical processes rather than computational dualism, then we should
expect several things to be true....


We'd expect neurons to disturb the fluid physically, amplifying and dampening
waves through interference patterns at different frequencies.

Expect certain ratios.

Expect areas to do with learning to change geometrically, rather than just
network topology.

Awareness should travel faster than neural activity, at the speed of sound in water.

More going on outside the neuron than inside it.

Perception would propagate from around the axons, rather than along them.

Neural networks that cause perception could be distributed and focus patterns
rhythmically together, rather than purely local calculations.

Ultrasound would have perceptual and induce cognitive effects.

Brain pressure would be destructive to consciousness.

Cognitive function would be more robust than the neural fibres.

Beta and alpha waves would feel perceptually smooth and sharp.

Experiences would feel fluid, rather than discrete, emotional waves.

Consciousness and unconsciousness could be measured vibrationally.

Anasthetics may have effects on fluid dynamics

Hallucinogenics of different types should cause sync issues that are better
explained with 

### option 2 - structured water and pressure on the lattice

Would be localized around the axons as structured water

Depend on quantum effects, sodium ion pressure on the hexagonal structure

### deeper reality

* water's hexagonal lattice, dimensionality
* forcing water to make a collective decision

## Is water special?

Does the hexagonal structure of water somehow align with the 3 spatial
dimensions, in a way that resonates with or provides access to the properties
from which space itself emerges? Does orientation play a part?

* The colliding blocks model of pi.
* Vibration as the underlaying cause of dimensionality
* The angles between the hexagonal lattice
* Further research required in understanding whether this makes water special,
  giving access to the substrate that space emerges from.


# Experimental Predictions

# Implications for Neuroscience & AI

- **Why AI lacks true awareness:** Unlike a neural network, which is digital and discrete, **a water-based system has no static states**—it is inherently dynamic and continuous.
- **New directions for brain-computer interfaces:** If consciousness is fluidic rather than computational, **interfaces should target water-structuring mechanisms rather than synaptic transmission alone.**
- **Implications for life’s origins:** If water is the agent of awareness, then **consciousness is not a late-stage evolutionary trick, but a fundamental property of structured aqueous environments.**

# Conclusion: Little Bags of Thinking Water

Pratchett described human beings as "little bags of thinking water held up
briefly by fragile accumulations of calcium", and despite us all believing we
were the bag, it turns out he was right all along.
