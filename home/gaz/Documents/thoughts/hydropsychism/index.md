# Abstract

The mystery of consciousness has baffled philosophers for centuries, yet Hard
Problems remain. Current computational models rely on a strong emergentist
dualism, treating mind as a mathematical abstraction with no causal effect on
natural selection. Panpsychist models are elegant but fail to explain how
subjective experience integrates into unified selves.

This paper proposes **hydropsychism** - the hypothesis that **the self is simply
the water around neurons**. This view is a simple panpsychist model that
explains evolution of mind from the earliest stages, lacks paradoxes, matches
observation and leads to testable predictions. This opens up the door to
building conscious machines.

# Metaphysics

*Cogito, ergo sum* was a decent starting point, but Descartes didn't go far
enough; there are some other things that I am[^1]. I'm in a location, I
experience my surroundings and the passage of time, I feel, and more
importantly - I choose how to move; I have will. And sometimes, the will to
think.

Monists, idealists and panpsychists successfully applied Occam's razor to the
thinking part, and reasonably concluded that there's no need for two different
mind and matter stuffs. Matter is what mind looks like from a distance, or, when
extra generous with the blade, it is the totality of existence itself[^2]. And
yet there's still much more for a reductionist to slice away. An objective
reality can emerge from a web of subjective interactions, and having experienced
both of those directly it is rational to consider the objective world a
second-order effect. Space can be framed so that distance is a relative
compatability of the things within it - the likelihood of interactions between
them - rather than a boundless and ghostly container. And as importantly as
before, we know that choice is the cause of our actions, and so without evidence
to the contrary, we should assume other stuff is its own first-mover.

If choice rather than commandment is the cause of actions, then physical laws
are nothing more than our own observations; all we can observe is the aggregate
preference of mind-stuff, statistically.

Having left the concept of natural laws and looking back from enough distance,
they resemble a cognitive bias at the heart of scientific tradition; the quest
to discover the laws of a rule-giver we have long forsaken[^3]. This path leads
us to a model of an entirely subjective and relative reality, one lacking not
only a creator and His laws, but is without a physical realm at all.

In this new model, mind-stuff is the only stuff and it acts according to its
will; it is and it does as it feels.

# Evolution of Mind

This position of "doing as it feels" reveals a simple mechanism by which mind
can evolve, and from up here we can see all the way back to abiogenesis.

When stuff chooses how to act based on what's around it, its actions then
change its surroundings, and this in turn changes its preferences. This simple
process provides a feedback loop where structure, feeling and action can be
naturally selected. With selection pressures able to act directly on feelings
and choices, they can evolve structurally, step by step - a process that is
required for sapient life to emerge.

Through this process, the simplest molecules with the weakest preferences can
be honed, through their survival, into complex systems with staunch opinions
and a powerful force of will.

If we lived in a universe made from experience and agency, we would expect
to see no boundary where they emerge. No matter how hard we look, or how
strongly we believe there is one, agency should extend all the way to the
bottom. The will to move would be present (though less coordinated) in not
just organisms without nervous systems, but also within their cytoplasm. An
amoeba's pseudopods would extend and retract with an apparent intent, and
white blood cells might chase invaders with what looks like urgency[^4]. If
Brownian motion is choice, then we should not be surprised to see the inner
workings of cells show an eerie similarity to creatures at larger scales[^5].
And it should apply across scales of time too; viewed at high speed, plants
would writhe and thrash around as they struggle to survive[^6]. Such
anthropomorphisms do not meet the high bar of scientific proof, yet these
observations provide clues, ones that once seen, are very difficult to unsee.

## Supernatural Selection

There's no reason why animals with brains couldn't evolve in a deterministic
universe, digital simulations suggest that they would. But in such systems -
ones without free will - there are no selection pressures to ratchet up a
complexity of mind. So what would evolve is control-calculation organs rather
than feeling-about-moving ones.

Deterministic models like computationalism and mathematical functionalism are
free from will, and so offer no causal mechanism through which mind can evolve.
Until one can be demonstrated, these symbolic dualisms are functionally
indistinguishable from evolution denial[^7].

# Informational Awareness

When described in terms of mass and electromagetism, of particles and forces,
we can describe and predict the behaviour of stuff, but this cannot explain the
cause of its behaviour. By definition, a subjective experience cannot be
measured objectively, so how another system feels will be forever beyond
empiricism's reach. This tautology cannot be escaped even if we invent
technology to connect other systems to our brains; a shared experience is no
longer entirely subjective. Though with this in mind, we should consider that
subjectivity itself may not be absolute, like all other things it's relative -
a matter of perspective.

Choices give some insight into the degree of preference or ignorance, of a
chooser, though how much of each are involved is anyone's guess. We could say
that atoms on the surface of a gold bar are unaware of the call of the sky, or
strongly prefer to stay where they are. Neutrinos could be said to be either
fickle or free, with no way to know which. This somewhat absurd framing does
grant an insight: if stuff is and does as it feels, then in one sense or another
it feels little about what it *doesn't* do.

This "actions as interaction choices" stance also provides a useful framing for
both quantum physics and information theory. Randomness and unknowableness are
functionally equivalent, and we know that unknowableness exists; randomness
does not survive the razor. This and entropy can be described as limits to
awareness itself, a minimum experiential distance from an observer; both
superposition and entanglement can be framed as an experiential exclusion from
a decision chain. And if forces themselves are preferences, then their carriers
are decisions rather than particles.

The more agency a system has, the less predictable it will be. So knowing what
something can do puts bounds on its possible agency, and by extension its
possibility for awareness. So, without assuming all men are Socrates, it's quite
reasonable to expect fluids to be far more aware - or at least have far more
capacity for awareness - than solids, which by comparison express no opinion.

# Hydropsychism

Life evolved on Earth through action, and if action is choice then water played
the lead role. This makes life's story less one about chemicals stumbling upon
awareness, it's one of taming the ocean's will - dividing, conquering, and
having it drag itself onto land. It's the water that flows and moves, it folds
and unfolds the proteins, pulling them together and pushing them apart.
Hydrophobic and hydrophilic forces give all cells structure, but it's water -
not lipids - that expresses philia and phobia. Water is the solvent of
all enzymes, the medium that transcribes our DNA, and ribozymes mediate
reactions through its fluidity and very little of their own. Fish don't realize
they're in water. The same can be said of organic chemistry.

Our throne of mind was built one drip at a time as nature slurped its way up the
gradient of complexity. This model's seat of consciousness is one of fluid
dynamics rather than quantum ones, one made of ordinary physical processes that
we refer to as physical law. It does not rest on the eternal Platonic forms
of symbolic dualism, nor the ignorance of complexity. No need to *mind the
gap*[^8], it's just plain old wet stuff, whatever stuff is anyway.

So, aside from determinism being functionally equivalent to evolution denial,
the central point of this paper is that neurons don't provide consciousness,
they manipulate the fluid around them, changing the texture of a liquid mind.

There are two obvious mechanisms that could lead to this behaviour, the most
simple - and the one taken so far - is that fluids as a whole have experience.
A less obvious one is that water's hexagonal structure is put under pressure
from sodium ions rushing into gates along the axons, and causing it to become
aware of the shape of the neuron's surface, and by extension the network as
a whole.

These two different viewpoints result in very different outcomes, in the
former, mind flows along the neurons themselves, while in the latter it would
flow throughout their liquid surroundings.

# Predictions for a Fluid Dynamic model

A fluid-dynamic model of consciousness is the most falsifiable one, but as a
lay-hacker-philosopher rather than a neurologist, I can only offer
intuition-based tests rather than technical ones. Regardless, the following
thoughts provide a starting predictions that may support empirical testing.

Neuron activations should disturb the fluid physically, amplifying and dampening
waves through interference patterns at different frequencies. The structure of
the network and the way the neurons fire would flow in rhythmic patterns, as
ionic ripples flow throughout the fluid. These 

We should expect areas to do with learning to change in a geometric fashion as
well as along the branches of the network. If awareness, or the cause of it,
propagates outwards from the axons rather than just along the network, areas
connected only by fluids ought to change around the focal or convergence
points related to different experiences.

There should be some manifestations of awareness that, travel faster than
neural activity, closer to the speed of sound in saline. We should expect
certain ratios to emerge, and for there to be types of neural structures that
cancel each other out by their position and rhythm to better cause more local
effects. We'd expect some forms of activity to be muted or shielded, like
when the neuron is used to route signals to another area without disturbing
the local fluid.

Parts of the network that provide calculations need not be entirely local,
we may see evidence of tightly synchronized areas that are closer by sea
than by land.

Changing the positions of neurons should change perceptual effects, even if
topology remains the same.

Ultrasound or other methods of inducing high frequency vibrations should create
cognitive effects. Beta and alpha waves would feel smooth and sharp
respectively. Brain pressure would be destructive to consciousness, but
cognitive function ought to be more robust than the neural fibres that mediate
it. Hallucinogenics of different types would likely cause sync issues that
expose interference patterns with a perceptual texture of the structure of the
brain, rather than its neural network. Some types of anasthetics should inhibit
consciousness by altering fluid dynamics.

The experiences of being human should feel fluid, rather than discrete firings
of neurons. It should be possible to measure consciousness and unconsciousness
vibrationally, and by applying vibrations in the right places, it ought to be
possible to directly control subjective experience.

# The structural experience of dimensionality

Given that π can be explained in terms of collision[^!], it's reasonable to
assume vibration is the cause of space. And it would make sense that directions
are only separate quantities for the sake of convenience; unlike directions,
one cannot rotate from 4 cats into 4 dogs.

If distance between objects is a proxy to preference, then spacetime does
not exist as a continuum but instead emerges from the things "within" it.
If so, the hexagonal lattice of water may align with the 3 spatial dimensions
themselves, in a way that resonates with, and provides access to, the
preferences that we observe as space. This may provide a mechanism whereby
pressure waves within water have direct causal effect on the experience and
awareness that sits below physical space.

# Conclusion: Little Bags of Thinking Water

For the past 20 years, I'd assumed that human consciousness the sweet song of
a wind of mind whistling through the structure of brains. A mind made of liquid
makes this aether far less immaterial, and something we know to exist.

Pratchett described human beings as "little bags of thinking water held up
briefly by fragile accumulations of calcium"[^?], and despite us mostly
believing we were the bag, it turns out he was right all along.
