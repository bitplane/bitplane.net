# Abstract

The mystery of consciousness has baffled philosophers for centuries, yet Hard
Problems remain.  Current computational models rely on a strong emergentist
dualism, treating mind as a mathematical abstraction with no causal effect on
natural selection.  Panpsychist models are elegant but fail to explain how
subjective experience integrates into unified selves.

This paper proposes **hydropsychism** - the hypothesis that **the self is simply
the water around neurons**.  This simple panpsychist model is reachable from
first principles, explains evolution of mind from the earliest stages, lacks
paradoxes, matches observation and leads to falsifiable predictions.

# Metaphysics

*Cogito, ergo sum* was a decent starting point, but Descartes didn't go far
enough; there are some other things that I am[^descartes].  I'm in a location, I
experience my surroundings and the passage of time, I feel, and more
importantly - I choose how to move; I have will.  And sometimes, the will to
think.

Monists, idealists and panpsychists successfully applied Occam's razor to the
thinking part, and reasonably concluded that there's no need for two different
mind and matter stuffs.  Matter is what mind looks like from a distance, or,
when extra generous with the blade, it is the totality of existence
itself[^budnik].  And yet there's still much more for a reductionist to slice
away.  An objective reality can emerge from a web of subjective interactions,
and having experienced both of those directly it is rational to consider the
objective world a second-order effect.  Space can be framed so that distance is
a relative compatibility of the things within it - the likelihood of
interactions between them - rather than a boundless and ghostly container.  And
as importantly as before, we know that choice is the cause of our actions, and
so without evidence to the contrary, we should assume other stuff is its own
first-mover.

If choice rather than commandment is the cause of actions, then physical laws
are nothing more than our own observations; all we can observe is the aggregate
preference of mind-stuff, statistically.

Having left the concept of natural laws behind, and looking back from a
distance, they resemble a cognitive bias at the heart of scientific tradition;
the quest to discover the laws of a rule-giver it has long forsaken[^cults].
This path leads us to a model of an entirely subjective, relative reality, one
where not only a creator and His laws are unknowable, but one without need for
a physical realm at all.

In this new model, mind-stuff is the only knowable stuff, and it acts according
to its will; it is and it does as it feels.

# Being a bit Clearer




# Evolution of Mind

This position of "doing as it feels" reveals a simple mechanism by which mind
can evolve, and from this vantage point we can see all the way back to
abiogenesis.

When stuff chooses how to act based on what's around it, its actions then
change its surroundings, which in turn changes its preferences.  This simple
process provides a feedback loop where structure, feeling and action can be
naturally selected. With selection pressures able to act directly on feelings
and choices, they can evolve structurally, step by step - a process that is
required for sapient life to emerge[^darwin].

Through this process, the simplest molecules with the weakest preferences can
be honed, through their survival, into complex systems with staunch opinions
and a powerful force of will.

If we lived in a realm of experience and agency, we would expect to see no
boundary where they emerge.  No matter how hard we look, or how strongly we
believe there is one, agency should extend all the way to the bottom. The will
to move would be present (though less coordinated) in not just organisms without
nervous systems, but also within their cytoplasm. An amoeba's pseudopods should
extend and retract with an apparent intent, and white blood cells might chase
invaders with apparent urgency[^blood].  If Brownian motion is choice, then we
should not be surprised to see the inner workings of cells show an eerie
similarity to creatures at larger scales[^cells].  And it should apply across
the scale of time too; viewed at high speed, plants might writhe and thrash
around like animals struggling to survive[^brambles]. Such anthropomorphisms do
not meet the high bar of scientific proof, yet these observations provide clues
that once seen, are very difficult to unsee.

## Supernatural Selection

There's no reason why animals with brains couldn't evolve in a deterministic
universe, digital simulations suggest that they would[^elife].  But in such
systems - ones without free will - there are no selection pressures to ratchet
up the complexity of mind, the richness of subjective experience.  So what would
evolve is control-calculation organs rather than feeling-about-moving ones.  And
while a sufficiently complex chooser may choose to calculate, there is no type
of calculator that can calculate to choose.

Deterministic models like computationalism and mathematical functionalism are
free from will, and so offer no causal mechanism through which mind can evolve.
Until one can be demonstrated, these symbolic dualisms are functionally
indistinguishable from evolution denial[^denial].

# Informational Awareness

When described in terms of mass and electromagnetism, of particles and forces,
we can describe and predict the behaviour of stuff, but this cannot explain the
cause of its behaviour.  By definition, a subjective experience cannot be
measured objectively, so how another system feels will be forever beyond
empiricism's reach.  This tautology cannot be escaped even if we invent
technology to connect other systems to our brains, as a shared experience is no
longer an entirely subjective one.  Keeping this possibility in mind, we should
consider that subjectivity itself is unlikely to be absolute, like all other
things it's relative and unevenly distributed - a matter of perspective.

Choices give some insight into the degree of preference or ignorance of a
chooser, though how much of each are involved is anyone's guess.  We could say
that atoms on the surface of a gold bar are unaware of the call of the sky, or
strongly prefer to stay where they are.  Neutrinos could be said to be either
fickle or free, with no way to know which.  These seemingly absurd framings do
grant an insight: if stuff is and does as it feels, then in one sense or another
it feels little about what it *doesn't* do.

This "actions as interaction choices" stance also provides a useful framing for
both quantum physics and information theory.  Randomness and unknowableness are
functionally equivalent, and we know that unknowableness exists; randomness
itself does not survive the razor.  These and entropy can be described as limits
to possible awareness, as a minimum possible experiential distance from an
observer.  Both superposition and entanglement can be framed as an experiential
exclusion from a decision chain.  And if forces themselves are preferences, then
their carriers are decisions rather than particles.

The more options a system can express, the less predictable it will be.  So
knowing what something can do puts bounds on its capacity for either agency or
awareness.  So, without assuming all men are Socrates, it's quite reasonable to
expect fluids to be far more aware - or at least have far more capacity for
awareness - than solids, which by comparison express no opinion.

# Hydropsychism

Life evolved on Earth through action, and if action is choice then water played
the lead role. This makes life's story less one about chemicals stumbling upon
awareness and more one of taming the ocean's will - dividing, conquering, and
having it drag itself onto land. It's the water that flows and moves, it folds
and unfolds the proteins by pulling them together and pushing them apart.
Hydrophobic and hydrophilic forces give all cells their structure, but it's
liquids not lipids that express philias and phobias. Water is the solvent of all
enzymes, the medium that transcribes our DNA[^dna], and its the fluidity of
water through which ribozymes mediate reactions, having far less of their own.
Fish don't realize they're in water. The same can be said of organic chemistry.

Our throne of mind was built one drip at a time as nature slurped its way up the
gradient of complexity. This model's seat of consciousness is one of fluid
dynamics rather than quantum ones, one made of ordinary physical processes that
we refer to as physical law. It does not rest on the eternal Platonic forms
of symbolic dualism, nor the ignorance of complexity. No need to *mind the
gap*[^lol], it's just plain old wet stuff, whatever stuff is anyway.

So, aside from determinism being functionally equivalent to evolution denial,
the central point is that neurons don't provide consciousness, they manipulate
the fluid around them, changing the texture of a liquid mind-stuff that
pre-dates evolution.

There are two obvious mechanisms that could lead to this, the most simple - and
the one taken so far - is that fluids as a whole have experience. A less direct
one is that water's hexagonal structure, when put under pressure from sodium
ions rushing into gates along neural axons force a decision on its movement,
causing it to become aware of the shape of the neuron's outer surface, and by
extension the network as a whole.

These two viewpoints result in very different outcomes. The former needs no
special quantum behaviour, being pure fluid-dynamics it can be explained in
terms of classical physics. A mind propagating in a geometric fashion is a
strong deviation from it traversing the network itself, leading to many
interesting predictions and a larger space for experimentation. It's also
simple and broadly accessible, both to laypeople and to the components that
formed the earliest stages of life.

In the latter, mind flows along the neurons themselves in the usual way, but
relies on unexplained quantum weirdness; collective behaviour in transition
state of structured water under pressure. This is enticing and leads to
implications in physics, but is far more difficult to observe and to reason
about. For this reason, I will focus mostly focus on the low hanging fruit.

# Predictions for a Fluid Dynamic Model

A fluid-dynamic model of consciousness is the most falsifiable one, but as a
lay-hacker-philosopher rather than a trained neuroscientist, I can only offer
intuition-based tests rather than highly technical ones. Regardless, I expect at
least some of the following to be empirically testable.

I should note that when I started writing this paper, I had no idea about how
the glymphatic system functions. A user on Biocord pointed this out to me, so
most of this paper was written without any idea that neurons are responsible for
pumping water around while we sleep. This is unlikely to be a coincidence, and
makes a fluid dynamic model a lot more likely than I thought before.

Let's assume that neuron activation disturbs the fluid physically, amplifying
and dampening waves through interference patterns at different frequencies.
That the neural network's signals are the mechanism of vibration, but also
compute and transmit information about where to exert these pressures.


## Geometric Propagation

Mind ought to be affected by processes that extend beyond the speed of neural
activations alone, which can only exert force laterally from the axons. While
neural signals propagate at known speeds, we might expect to also observe
manifestations of awareness that involve interactions occurring at speeds
approaching that of sound waves in saline, rather than purely electrochemical
propagation[^fluid].

Network regions that provide high-resolution perceptual experiences ought to be
either denser or more structured[^nature], and we may expect to see evidence of
tightly synchronized areas[^pmc] that are closer by sea than by land.

Neurons should fire in rhythmic patterns[^buzsaki], with lower frequency waves 
having broader and more global effects on perception[^klimesch]. 
Lower frequency oscillations, such as alpha waves (~8–12 Hz), are associated 
with large-scale neural synchrony and modulate distant brain regions[^thut], 
whereas higher frequency oscillations, like gamma waves (~30–100 Hz), are 
linked to localized sensory processing[^fries].

We should expect learning processes like memory formation to reshape geometric 
areas as well as network connections[^ecm]. These changes aren't just a 
by-product of chemical signals leaking into the fluid but an active mechanism
of memory itself[^buffer]. The brain's extracellular matrix provides more 
than scaffolding - it dynamically regulates synaptic plasticity, influencing
how  memories form and persist[^fluidity]. Memory isn't just a network effect;
it's also a structural shift in the brain's landscape.

If geometry plays a role beyond just topology, then altering the physical
position of neurons - without changing network connections - could have
perceptual effects[^spatial]. While traditional models focus on connectivity
alone, emerging research suggests that spatial positioning influences neural
signalling, potentially shaping perception[^cortical]. This remains an open
question but offers a testable hypothesis for future research.

## Interference Mechanisms

If awareness, or the cause of it, propagates outwards from the axons rather
than just along the network, then there must be control mechanisms to perturb
the patterns precisely, and lots of them since they evolved by chance.

We should expect certain ratios to be present to support this functionality, 
such as factors and co-prime relationships between the speed of waves, neuron 
activations, and node distances[^jneurosci]. Harmonic relationships between 
oscillations, like simple integer ratios (e.g., 1:2), facilitate synchronization 
and efficient communication between different brain regions[^aps]. Ways to 
dampen, support, reflect, focus, constrain, and promote propagation should be 
built into the spatial arrangement of the network.

These effects would likely be moderated by chemical and structural compositions
and densities[^ecm]. They may be most noticeable at boundaries of regions
we know to be responsible for specific perceptual effects, where differences in 
tissue composition and structure alter signal dynamics[^boundaries].

The importance of spatial positioning and firing rhythms should have more local
importance to higher frequency and higher density waves. Effects that reach
further ought to need less synchronization and allow greater margin for
error[^theta]. Highly textured experiences might use tightly synchronized,
denser structures that increase resolution through phase
relationships[^texture].

We'd expect some forms of activity to be muted or shielded, like when a
neuron is used to route signals to another area without disturbing the local
fluid. Neural back-propagation provides an example of this, where A-type
potassium channels regulate returning action potentials to prevent interference
with local processing[^backprop]. Similarly, patterns of neurons may exist
to force ripples along a certain path while dampening them along others, a
mechanism resembling 'communication through coherence', where oscillatory
synchronization ensures selective signal transmission[^ctc].

## Physical Effects on Perception

Ultrasound or other methods of inducing high frequency vibrations should cause 
cognitive effects[^tfus]. Beta and alpha waves would also feel smooth and sharp 
respectively[^brainwaves].

Brain pressure changes might be destructive to consciousness itself rather than 
just the brain[^icp]. Perceptual awareness ought to be more robust than cognitive 
function; the neural fibres that mediate complexity of experience have no bearing 
on its physical existence[^perception].

Hallucinogenics of different types would likely have perceptual textures that
are experiences of the structure of the brain's volume, rather than its
neural network[^trip].

Some types of anaesthetics may inhibit consciousness physically, through effects 
on fluid dynamics[^anesthetics], as should chemicals to do with feelings such as 
pleasure and pain. We might expect that chemicals related to strong feelings to 
be similarly disruptive to liquids.

The experiences of being human should feel fluid, rather than jittery, discrete
firings of neurons. We would expect there to be no specific seat of
consciousness if it were fluid[^dennett]. It should be possible to measure
consciousness and unconsciousness vibrationally, and by applying vibrations in
the right places, it ought to be possible to invoke wakefulness[^vibration], and
with enough control, even directly create complex subjective experiences[^sleep].

# The Structural Experience of Dimensionality

Given that π can be explained in terms of collision[^pool], it's reasonable to
assume vibration is the cause of space. And it would make sense that directions
are only separate quantities for the sake of convenience; unlike directions,
one cannot rotate from 4 cats into 4 dogs.

If distance between objects is a proxy to preference, then spacetime does
not exist as a continuum but instead emerges from the things "within" it.
If so, the hexagonal lattice of water may align with the 3 spatial dimensions
themselves, in a way that resonates with, and provides access to, the
preferences that we observe as space. This may provide a mechanism whereby
pressure waves within water have direct causal effect on the experience and
awareness that sits below physical space.

# Conclusion: Little Bags of Thinking Water

For the past 20 years, I'd assumed that human consciousness the sweet song of
a wind of mind whistling through the structure of brains. A mind made of liquid
makes this aether material, and something we know to exist.

Pratchett described human beings as "little bags of thinking water held up
briefly by fragile accumulations of calcium"[^tez], and despite us mostly
believing we were the bag, it turns out he may have been right all along.
