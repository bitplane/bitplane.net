# ðŸª¦ RIP `gdlib.net`

My Game Developer library site, containing a few hundred megs of resources and
technical videos for game developers was deleted by the absolute bellend
"Richard H" of rhserve.com / goldendollarhosting.com.

What a fucking prick.

Fuck you, Richard. Learn to keep your promises you sack of shit.
