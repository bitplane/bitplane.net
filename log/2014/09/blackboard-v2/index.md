# 🕑 blackboard clock v2

So the [first one](../03/blackboard-clock) was too small, so we painted a
piece of faux slate with the blackboard paint and moved the clock mechanism
over to it.

Looks better and is more useful, apart from the writing - the texture is
not as smooth.

* 🧲 No longer magnetic
* ✏️ Harder to write on
