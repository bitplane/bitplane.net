# name.sh

So, my daughter was named by a bash script. True story. We had a candidate list
of 4 names and couldn't decide between them, and I was ... uh ... instructed is
putting it too lightly, forcefully asked to just write a program or something
that will figure it out.

So I did. The universe and SHA picked the name from a hat, and our beautiful
baby girl was named Rebecca for a few seconds due to a missing newline. Then
she was called Jess. She's great, but her dad is a nerd.
