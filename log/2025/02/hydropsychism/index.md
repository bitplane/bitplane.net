# 🌊 A water of mind

For a while I've been thinking about a simple mechanism for consciousness,
to compliment the "computationalism is evolution denial" argument that I've
been screaming about for the last year or so.

And I finally did it. Thanks to ChatGPT's criticism (and none of its prose) I
managed to turn a casual, sweary rant into a coherent metaphysical stance on
consciousness, one that actually puts its cock on the block by making
falsifiable predictions.

It is of course wrong, at least judging by history; nobody has ever been right
on this topic before. I am just another hairless ape trying to make sense of the
world after all. But it's a take that's fresh enough that time hasn't worn away
all the meaningful parts until all that remains are empty words and abstraction.

So it's wrong, but maybe it's less wrong, and that's all we can ever hope to be.

## tl;dr

It's nothing special, it's just water. Your mind is just the water in your head.
