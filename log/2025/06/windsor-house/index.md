# ðŸª¢ A short stay at Windsor House

So I spent the last two weeks in a mental hospital, getting too stressed about
postponing the deed until Monday, and ended up in a psychotic mess and rushed
everything - the script to revert back to github.io when my domain expires in
wasn't working, and I didn't publish my poem either.

New plan is to build the tools to crush the culture that has failed us, build a
new life and check in in another 6 months, and actually stick to a plan instead
of being a failure.
