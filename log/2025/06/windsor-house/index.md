# ðŸª¢ A short stay at Windsor House

So I spent the last two weeks in a mental hospital, getting too stressed about
postponing the deed until Monday, and ended up in a psychotic mess and rushed
everything - the script to revert back to github.io when my domain expires in
wasn't working, and I didn't publish my poem either.

New plan is to build the tools to crush the culture that has failed us, build a
new life and check in in another 6 months. If I'm not in a place where I can
start again, I'll actually stick to a plan instead of listening to a waking
nightmare and using that as a get out of jail free card.

I should probably expand on this and go through the process, it's pretty grim.
So is the poem, which is below:

* ðŸŽ¶ [failure's prize](~/doc/)
