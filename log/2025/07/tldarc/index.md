A list of domains, so we don't have to go cap in hand to registrars for zone
files, sign agreements and pay them money when we don't even care about most of
them anyway and don't want to agree to keep things secret.

Took 8 days on my 1gbps connection, ~35GB of output data, processed 10TB of
compressed archives down to a couple of gigs.

## Data
