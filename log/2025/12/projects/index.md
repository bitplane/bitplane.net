# 🌐 Project Archaeology

I recovered an old SVN repo checked out from a hard drive backup circa 2009,
and have pushed as much as I could to github.

It's not the big one - the Amiga hard drive with a ton of games on it that need
decoding and making web friendly, or the ISA disk that might need proper
recovery, or any of the 486 Pascal era stuff on floppies, or the ZX spectrum
tapes and the microdrive that's likely dead. And unfortunately my Android and
iOS stuff wasn't on this disk. But this is a nice chunk of the missing source
from this site's 25 (of 40) year trove.
