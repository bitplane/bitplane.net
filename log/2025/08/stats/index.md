# 📊 pypi stats

[pypi](https://pypi.org/) stats are held in Google BigtTable, and available
publicly. The data is enormous, but it is possible to scan a month or five
on the free tier. So I made this monthly stats thing:

![stats](/dev/python/stats.svg)

It runs on GitHub and commits a cache to its own repo, then pushes an svg
of the last 12 months of downloads to this repo once a month.

Or I hope it will; we'll find out on the first of September.
