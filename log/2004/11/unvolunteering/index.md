# 👋 unvolunteering from xbmc plugin support

i haven't been around for a few months, and i'd like to apologise to the people
i said i'd write code for. i shouldnt make promises that i havent got the
willpower to keep.

i still havent got a working xbox (but thats no excuse, i have access to one)
but the truth is i haven't been bothered debugging python in xbmc anymore cos it
hurts a lot more than it rewards. let it be known that i'm a quitter.

i'll probably do some more xbmc pythings eventually, but i'm not pissing around
tidying third hand code, or making things that i have no use for; coding passion
is all about self indulgence, so whetever i do next will have to give me a full
blown hard on or similar level of excitement! i'll keep this in mind before i
take on future projects

anyone want to take over on the divxstation subtitle downloader, help add
functions to the emulator scripts, skin aqt (if this still needs doing), drop me
a mail and i'll send you what code i have.

you haven't heard the last of me, i'll still be quietly reverse engineering ttx
files (teletext) and messing with my irc client and py9 dictionary.
