# 🧑‍💻 Software

I started programming [as a kid](basic), and have enjoyed it for over 40 years.
With less than a decade left before I lose my memory, this set of pages acts
as less volatile storage, if not for code then at least a bit of a record of
the projects I've worked on.

Note there's a lot of stuff and this is ongoing, so it'll be a while before
all the links work.

The best stuff is in:

* 🐍 [python](python)
* 🔨 [c++](c++)
* 📜 [sh](sh)
