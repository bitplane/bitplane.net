# 🧑‍💻 Software

I started programming [as a kid](basic), and have enjoyed it for about 40 years
or so. Less than a decade left before I lose my memory, this set of pages acts
as less volatile storage, if not for code then at least a bit of a record of
the projects I've worked on.

Note there's a lot of stuff and this is ongoing, so it'll be a while before
all the links work. The best stuff is in [python](python), [c++](c++) and
[sh](sh).
