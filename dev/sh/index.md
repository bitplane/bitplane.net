# Shell scripting

Does AmigaDOS count as shell scripting? If so I've been doing shell scripts
since '93. If not then probably 99 or so when I did [c](../c) in XENIX.

After Windows Vista drove me to Linux I became okay at it, then proficient by
doing it daily in Dockerfiles during the DevOps revolution. More recently,
adopting a modular approach with a bit of help from ChatGPT and Claude, I'm
actually writing real programs in `sh` and `bash`, using function libraries that
are merged together when building a release.
