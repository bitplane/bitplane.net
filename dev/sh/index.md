# Shell scripting

Does AmigaDOS count as shell scripting? If so I've been doing shell scripts
since '93. If not then probably 99 or so when I did [c](../c) in XENIX.

That said, it's probably only since Windows Vista drove me to Linux I became any
good at it, and it's not something I've written actual projects in. I do tend to
use Makefiles and bash scripts where possible.

If I find some actual shell script projects from over the years, I'll add them
here:

* [🌐 pierdat](https://github.com/bitplane/pierdat) -
  Docker containers that host their own data.
* [➡️ subcmd](https://github.com/bitplane/subcmd) -
  A shell script that converts `cmd subcmd` -> `cmd-subcmd` for you.
* [🖼️ some ascii effects](asciinema-fx) -
  Some Windows Blue Screen of Death scripts.
* [📷 lifecap](https://github.com/bitplane/lifecap) -
  Capture your life for local AI agent processing.
