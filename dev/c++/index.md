# C++

C++ gets a lot of stick, and there's good reasons for it. But despite its flaws
it was popular enough to have decent debugging tools for a lot of its life,
making it as useful as it is dangerous.

I got into C++ by writing games for Nikolaus Gebhardt's Irrlicht Engine, an open
source 3D graphics library for the fixed-function pipeline that abstracts the
rendering back-end and operating system away, making it perfect for cross
platform, device agnostic games programming.

So most of my C++ work is stuff done for Irrlicht, which I was on the dev team
for several years - until I gave up on the idea of writing games and moved on to
more boring, real things.

## Games

Some games, none of any note.

* [irrvaders](irrvaders) -
  A space invaders game with a cylindrical coordinate system.
* [jetpac](jetpac) -
  A remake of JetPac.
* [jump or burn](jumporburn) -
  Ridiculously crap game made for a gaming contest.
* [mines](mines) -
  Minesweeper game.
* [UFO game](ufo-game) -
  A game that Graeme and I never finished.

## Irrlicht Scene Nodes

Things that make your world pretty

* [axial-billboards](axial-billboards) -
  Axis aligned billboards, like Mariokart on the SNES.
* [batching-mesh](batching-mesh) -
  A mesh that batches its children, so you can use fewer render calls.
* [beam-scene-node](beam-scene-node) -
* A screen-aligned beam effect. Basically a rod with a billboard on each end.
* [clouds](clouds) -
  Clouds with recursive levels of detail.
* [grass](grass) -
  A grass patch scene node, used in a few popular games.
* [impostors](impostors) -
  Distant items become billboards, making enormous scenes possible.
* [plantlod](plantlod) -
  A quad tree to render loads of stuff, loaded from disk and culled depending
  on distance.
* [spheremap renderer](spheremap-renderer) -
  Render the scene into a spheremap, for use in lighting effects.
* [skybox renderer](skybox) -
  Render your scene into a sky box. Same as above, but for performance reasons.

## Tools

* [3d mesh thumbnailer](thumbnailer) -
  A Gnome thumbnailer for 3D mesh file formats.
* [font generator](font-generator) -
  The cross platform Irrlicht font generator.
* [GUI Editor](gui) -
  The GUI editor for Irrlicht.

## Irrlicht Loaders and Internals

* [figlet driver](figlet-driver) -
  Loading figlet fonts on the console device, or wherever.
* [console device](console-device) -
  Created as a null device, became an ASCII device for software drivers
* [ico-loader](ico-loader) -
  Load Windows icon and cursor files in your Irrlicht app.
* [loader profiler](loader-profiler) -
  Profile the various loaders for the Irrlicht Engine.
* [ply loader](ply-loader) -
  A loader for Stanford Polygon with blistering performance due to ugly hacks.
* [rsrc-loader](rsrc-loader) -
  Load resources from Windows DLL and EXE files.
