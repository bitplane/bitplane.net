# 🐍 Python stuff

I've been programming in Python since about 2001. I think it was Mo Patel, the
legend that he is, who showed me the ropes while we were doing C/C++ while load
testing software for the Department for Work and Pensions.

Python's probably my favourite language and has been a constant throughout my
adult life. Back then I would have called it a modern BASIC. I still think
that's a fair comment.

  nice results visualization/reporting/diffing tools for perf tools in CI.
  Didn't get permission to share the reporting tools, so all that survives is
  a bug report!
