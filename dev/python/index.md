# Python stuff

I've been programming in Python since about 2001. I think it was Mo Patel, the
legend that he is, who showed me the ropes while we were load testing software
using Facilita Forecast at the Department for Work and Pensions.

Python's probably my favourite language and has been a constant throughout my
adult life. Back then I would have called it a modern BASIC, and I still think
that's still fair comment.
