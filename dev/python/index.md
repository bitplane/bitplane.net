# Python stuff

I've been programming in Python since about 2001. I think it was Mo Patel, the
legend that he is, who showed me the ropes while we were load testing software
using Facilita Forecast at the Department for Work and Pensions.

Python's probably my favourite language and has been a constant throughout my
adult life. Back then I would have called it a modern BASIC, and I still think
that's still fair comment.

## Python dev things

## Older projects

* [XBMC IRC](xbmc) -

## Commercial stuff

* At NDA PROTECTED CLIENT, I've been writing bots and command line tools and
  libraries in Python.

* For [First Response Finance](https://www.firstresponsefinance.co.uk/), I
  wrote an ML Ops inference and deployment framework for delivering Python + R
  machine learning models as APIs to Azure.

* At [William Hill](https://www.williamhill.com/) I wrote note and coin
  acceptor drivers for multiple devices, and a bunch of other things for a
  gaming machine.

* For [Betconnect](https://www.betconnect.com/), I did a bunch of performance
  engineering for their exchange software.

* At [Sonocent](https://glean.co/), I wrote a BI platform to support business
  experiments.

* At NHS Digital, I worked on the SPINE 2 project doing various things, probably
  the biggest TDD Python codebase in the world.

* Someone on bitcointalk paid me 6 Bitcoins to write a data scraper for a
  violin sale site. I wish I'd kept them, they were worth $36 at the time.

* At BetFair, I used [funkload](https://github.com/nuxeo/funkload) for
  performance testing and submitted a couple of bug fixes and made some pretty
  nice results visualization/reporting/diffing tools for perf tools in CI.
  Didn't get permission to share the reporting tools, so all that survives is
  a bug report!
