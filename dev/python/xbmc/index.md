# XBMC

Back in the good old days when we were chipping Xboxes on the sly in the back
of a government datacenter, I was writing scripts for what used to be known as
Xbox Media Center Media Center (XBMC Media Center for short), or Kodi as it's
now known.

The reason Kodi got support for DVB TV broadcasts is because at the time, back
in 2005 or so, I posted a DVB tuner card to one of the devs.

Here's some things I was messing about with at the time:

 * 🗪 [IRC](irc) - An MP3 downloader for XBMC
 * 🎢 [Skins for XBMC](skin) - A skin library from before XBMC supported skins.
 * ☎️ [Py9](../t9) - An input library for the remote control, in the style of
   Nokia T9.
