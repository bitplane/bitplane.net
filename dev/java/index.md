# Java

I'm not a fan of Java, never have been. This could be because of a traumatic
experience with it - before getting a job with Facilita load testing software
for Littlewoods, I had to cram it in a weekend along with learning BNF, and
then spend months hacking machine-generated spew into Oracle Forms automation
code that were recorded from its traces. Or maybe it's because it's the natural
language of FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition, or that I feel like a downtrodden verb
in the
[Kingdom of Nouns](https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html).

But I still wrote some stuff in it anyway, mostly a few Android apps that are
no longer used by anyone.

* [Anonypic](anonypic) -
  Upload images to the now defunct BayImg image host.
* [Microphone](microphone) -
  Use your Android device as a microphone.
* [Missed Call Mailer](missed-call-mailer) -
  Get an email when you miss a call, for callcenter workers.
* [Rainwatch](rainwatch) -
  Maps from the BBC showing the only weather British people care about.
* [SVG Renderer](svg-renderer) -
  Render an SVG file on your phone.
